TDD - what it is \ my experiences 

Test coverage
	Coming from a testing background I've always been hyper focusd on testing and automated testing at that. Automated testing is what stands in the way of needing to have your devlopers come in on the weekend and stand back up servers that have fallen over.
	To that end I have always aimed for a high level of test coverage. Using Sonar cube and what ever inbuilt pipeline gates where available to insure a high level of coverage and Stability. I aim for 95% test coverage.

	Tools used: SonarCube, xUnit, nUnit
	Azure, Jenkins

Types of test 
- **Unit Tests:** Test individual components in isolation.
- **Integration Tests:** Test how different components work together.
- **End-to-End Tests:** Test the entire system from a user's perspective.
