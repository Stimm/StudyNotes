Good morning/afternoon/evening.

My name is Timothy, and I'm a seasoned software engineer with a passion for delivering high-quality software and  sustainable devlopment environments. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering and am a certified Scrum Master with the Scrum alliance.

Over the past two years, I've had the privilege of leading and mentoring multiple teams as Chapterlead, Team leader and Scrum Master. In these roles, I've gained valuable experience in cross-functional collaboration, software development lifecycle management, and agile methodologies. I'm particularly proud of my ability to foster a culture of continuous improvement and proactively implement process enhancements.

# If migration/Microservices is important
I'm very fortunate to have been brought on to my previous role to as a team lead where I got the opportunity set up and grow two full cross-functional teams for a migration initiative. I was evolved in the hiring, training and organizing of 16 developers and helped migrate an old monolithic/all in one architecture project into a .Net Cloud based micro service architecture. In that time we migrated over into 100 APi's and 5 services into a new trunked based CD/CI pipeline and have successfully deployed to 6 europium airlines.

# if testing is important
I got to lead the a testing initiative that helped mondernanize the companies testing standards, form both a UnitTesting and continuous testing point of view. Increasing the code coverage by 90% and greatly increasing the stability and testability of the product overall.

I'm confident in my ability to contribute significantly to your team and drive innovation. Thank you for your time and consideration."
