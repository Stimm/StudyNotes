The aim of this process is obviously to get a good job but depending on what job I go for I will need to prepare accordingly.

As it stands there is one role I want a [[Engineering Manager]] but I might take a [[Chapter lead]] role if I cant find the former.

There will be mutable rounds to every interview and how I present my self will directly effect my chances.

The stages will be
- [[Initial recruiter screening]]
- [[HR Screening]]
- [[Engineering Screening]]
- [[Coding exam]]
- [[Leader Ship Screening]]
- [[Executive Screening ]]


Each of these screenings will have there own goals and points systems and I need to be prepaired to try and "Win" each of these interviews by saying the correct key phrases, talking about the necessary experiences and knowledge's required for each screening and asking and interrogating the correct questions.

I will also need to target the [[companies]] I want to work for making sure to send out my CV when opertunities arise

I will also need to look at migrating to [[London]] if I am not getting the opportunities here in Dublin
