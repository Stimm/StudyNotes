#### Introduce your self

Describe your self
Hello NAME. Thank you so much for having me here today. 

I would discrive my self as a 
Confadent
resilant
result driven
infinitly curious
empathetic 
Leader


I'm some one who is able to support their secinour leadership team and help them acchieve their organizational goals. I like to keep communacation lines between me and the leader ship as open and easy as possible as i view leader ship as my mentors not just my bosses. I give regular updates on projects and initives that i'm overseeing and I take full responsibility for what happens with in my teams.

As a team lead I am able to support and motivate my colleges with their Projects and sprit goals as well as profeshional and personal goals, with a strong leaning to mentorship. 
I have had the wonderful experiance of leading and managing difficult teams of pashionat engineers in projects with ambiguas requirments and enthuseastic deadlines delivering not only sucess but improving the processes and culture of the team. I'm a self driven individual who knows and has proven that a empothertic aproch can not only increase productivity but promote better retention and improved satisfaction for both teams and clients. 

I have a strong attention to detail and take the inititave when it comes to the projects I work on and do not limit those qualities to just my technical functions. When presented with systematic issues with in teams and companies I'm quick to find allies, put forword solutions, devlop roadmaps and then lead organizationl reforms to promote improvements that allow organizations to deliver on there goals. An example of this would be how i lead the Agile modernization inititive with in Retail in motion. What started off as me idintifying issues with in my team lead to a organization change that had wide sweeping posotive effects on the entire organization.

As a leader with in teams I let empathy be my primary axium. I work in zero blame enviorments, where inclusitivity is key so that anyone who joines my teams can feel that they have place and and that they can do their best work. Through make use of existing indistory standards, Coaching, delegatig and sharing my vision I am able to create environments that promote, sustainable coding practices, better coding standards, opportunities for upskilling and ownership but more importantly greatly improved productivity.

In the end of the day the metric to my successes is in what we deliver. But Its not enough for me to hit a dead line and have our code pushed to production. Its that we where able to do so in a organized, happy manner and ready for the next Sprint.

And I know that as a team lead I could be a valuable asset for Rakuten Kobo




Decribe your previous role

Introduction: I was hired to Lead and build out two teams of engineers a create a chapter who where focued on the migration of a Monolitic single page, aspx,  tightly coupled to a SQL DB, single user aplaction into a Multy tennent, entatiy framework enabled cloud based set of microservices.

I got to take part in all aspects of the project:
- Team building
	- Hiring
	- Upskilling
	- Mentoring
	- Conflict resalution 
	- goal setting
- Project desing
	- Technical stack
	- Tools
	- Coding standards
- QA standards
	- Unittesting
	- Automated testing standards
- Project managemnt
	- Methodoligies 
	- Ceramonies
	- Removing blockers
	- Communicating functional communacation
	- Process changes

	I got to lead the team on technical deep dives and discussions taking on initives such as detrmining our Distributed transactions solution. Leading deep examinations into horrifically large Stored procedures so that we would be able to redesign core features of the original systems. 

	Identify individuals who where ready to take on more responsibly an elevate them into leadership

	And eventually I would get to lead company wide initiatives to modernize their agile approach.

Give a time where you had to deal with a problematic coliege
 Omo/PO
- **Situation**: Product owner was underperforming, putting the project at risk and causing friction with in the team.
- **Task:** To understand what was preventing my PO from shining, identify why and do what I could to help him.
- **Action:** With permishion from my manager engaging with the PO to understand why. Identifying that he was undersuported by the Product team and reorganized our project workflow to assist him.
- **Result**: A new project work flow that suported the Po in his daily activites. Redused bugs and defects increased productivity across the board and lead to better well written user stories.

### Give an example where you lead from a technical point of view 
- **Situation**: Distrabuted systems failing when propagating messages to more than two applactions
- **Task:** Picking the best soultion over two. Drawing up POCs. Garnering Stakeholder buying and then upscailing
- **Action:** Did early investagation of two solutions, made PoC's, worked with systems team and archecture teams, Ran presentations of three case sceniros, brought to stake stake holders (Product, engineering, design) for review and buy in. Sign off from the systems and archecture teams. Work shops and upskilling the 3 diffrent teams.
- **Result**: Standard distributed messaging solution


	- Points to cover
		- What the project was
			- Technical goals: Scailability, Distributed
			- .net 4.7 sql, busines slevels stored in SQL to cloud based, distrabuted, entity framework, restufll microservices arcetucture 
		- Complacations
			- Technical discription of the problem a->b->c
			- fine for Read or one app write
		- Solutions
			- Saga Pattern
				- How it works
					- exacuters
					- compensators
				- Its inherent problems
					- What if a compensator fails
				- Why we did not go with it
			- Messaging 
				- How it works
					- Publishing messages to topics
					- Publishing failed messages to topics for role backs
					- How this effects the a-b-c problem
				- Its inherent problems and solutions
					- Missed messages
						- Resend queues
						- higher level of monitoring till system was fully stable
					- Fully distributed 
						- Failed Messages needed to contain all nessesory information for roleback
					- Complexity
						- Knolodge gap
							- Devs
							- Product Design
		- Outcome
			- Fully asyncronus system like amazon
				- Parralel operations
					- Order example
						- While we might not be able to complete the emailling aspect of the invoicing applaction all the work for flaging products and status setting  with in the ware houses with in the OrderManagment applaction for transportation can be compleated. We could even set those products into a holding state and then save the data to a temporory table and then send a async message to a users error message service that there was an issue with there order and that they needed to fix a email.
				- Would help with the decopuling of the DB
					- Future proofing us for true microservices
					- Not a full proof solution a tool  
			
												
- We had been migrating domains into microservices. Untill this point we had been dealing with cross domin calls that would only call another domain but finilay we reached a feature that had multy domain comunacation. This led to issues and questions about how we where going to handle fail states.

	Migrating .net 4.7 sql, busines slevels stored in SQL. to ne new system. Resttfull clean arcetucture. Issue: ass we where moving to distribuated arcetucture. Distributed transactions. Able to handle read transactions and write transactions with two applactions/domains invloved. Handled through a Saga pater. Compleate the work in a, the B if b failed role back b then a. Issues came when we brough in the 3rd domain and write transcations.

		Issue of a -> b -> c
	Two posoble solutions Saga pattern, event sourseing pattern. POC orleion sagas.
	Not recomended for production use. 
when you build a saga you have exacure and compensates: 
Exacute Do something in oms
Compensates: Fix the shit and role back.

If you have a chain of exacutes that fail it has to call the compensates all the way back.

If a compensate fails or throws an exception you are cooked. Bad info in the DB

You can have retries but we where not confadent in delivering a strong solution 

It raised to many issues so we decided no to go with it. We talked to Systems team and arcetuctures teams. and there where no anwsers to the problems so we all agreed that the negatives where no fixable so we moved on to event soursing.

The idea is that each process would create a message. If you need A to talk to B to talk to C then you would create messages in that string.

You would create methods for handling role backs based on spesfic edg cases. 

We where going to be creating a asyncoris error messaging center that would update the user if there was an issue.

Like amazon you could recieve a message to let you knoiw that something went wrong and you need to fix.

Because it was async and event soursing we could have process runing in parrlell. and they would work regardless of sucessfull or un sucessful and then they would publish the message.

Gets complex when you have mutaple ones all consuming the same message and the next step was to trial these kind of ways.

B would fail and send a message for A and C to role back, we would have to evaluate all the edge cases. Its just a tool and we would might not need ot use this tool for ever sceniro. Would work with the Product and Design team to find out if it was needed. How are the users gfoing to use it what do they expect to happen. How would we handled if this failed. 

We could use temp storage to keep the state of the data and try and resend or fix later or we could cancle the entire orded, do we want to cancle a order if one email is broken or not.

Is saga or eventpattern bullit profe No, but in our scenirios it was acceptable. 

We could make it better with additional monatoring, health checks. 

When it comes to distributed transactions there is no correct way, its about finding the the most consistent. 

Once you walk away from a database you will never have a perfect system and this was just the way we had for our project. Our next step was to implament it.

IF we had gone to productioin we would of had grate insights

Its posoble that we might have needed to withdrawn the event patern and instead go for a orcastrator pattern.

and thats where we where.

We where not dealing with lots of users.

Challanges: Knolodge with the team, training the devlopers, working closly with design and product to help them understand. How we could use the pros and mitagate the cons.

Such as lets modafy the UI to allow for an order send but notafy that the email had failed. 

Design team where happy with this because it gave them the ability to make new screans with better design feel for the users.


Tools: Kafka was our message buss. Had already in place a comon structure which had the ability to publish messages. Our API's had originaly been designed to use Kafaka from a previous project. 

We where going to implament Kafka as the tool to publish the messages so that we would have publishes and consumers to handle the message. Each applaction can listen to ### Topics you can publish to topics so that any app can consume those messages. Wether or not they want to persist them that can be built in the future.

.Net, core Entity frame work, Extra impolamentation of Kafka, deploying on Docker, publishing images onto a cluster. deploy kafka into that cluster then publish to the cluster.

Kafka is a messaging bus, messages can be consumed out of order and we need to mitagate that. 

The compensations we where having to do rather than applactions know how other applactions work the messages we where publishing would contain all the infformation the applaction would need to compleate a process. Stattuses, id's all needed to be recorded in that message.

Saga always gave us conserns that we could not slove

Messageing gave us a solution that we thought we could use
We created uml diagrams of 3 diffrent scenirios and worked though how the messageing would work. We brough to the systems team and the arcetucuter team, we descussed how it would would and then got the sign off. Had a poc, backing of the arcetucre team and the systems who we worked with to insure it was a viable solution 

Next step get every one on board, Hosting workshops for not only the Dev teams but the Product and Design team. Some who where technical and some who where not.

The devlopers: explaining why we whet which this choice and why we did not want to reinvent the weal and how we need to work though it and hammer out the kinks.

Technical terms for SQL databases ACID look at transactions
