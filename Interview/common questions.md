Describe your self
Hello NAME. Thank you so much for having me here today. 

I would discrive my self as a 
Confadent
resilant
result driven
infinitly curious
empathetic 
Leader


I'm some one who is able to support their secinour leadership team and help them acchieve their organizational goals. I like to keep communacation lines between me and the leader ship as open and easy as possible as i view leader ship as my mentors not just my bosses. I give regular updates on projects and initives that i'm overseeing and I take full responsibility for what happens with in my teams.

As a team lead I am able to support and motivate my colleges with their Projects and sprit goals as well as profeshional and personal goals, with a strong leaning to mentorship. 
I have had the wonderful experiance of leading and managing difficult teams of pashionat engineers in projects with ambiguas requirments and enthuseastic deadlines delivering not only sucess but improving the processes and culture of the team. I'm a self driven individual who knows and has proven that a empothertic aproch can not only increase productivity but promote better retention and improved satisfaction for both teams and clients. 

I have a strong attention to detail and take the inititave when it comes to the projects I work on and do not limit those qualities to just my technical functions. When presented with systematic issues with in teams and companies I'm quick to find allies, put forword solutions, devlop roadmaps and then lead organizationl reforms to promote improvements that allow organizations to deliver on there goals. An example of this would be how i lead the Agile modernization inititive with in Retail in motion. What started off as me idintifying issues with in my team lead to a organization change that had wide sweeping posotive effects on the entire organization.

As a leader with in teams I let empathy be my primary axium. I work in zero blame enviorments, where inclusitivity is key so that anyone who joines my teams can feel that they have place and and that they can do their best work. Through make use of existing indistory standards, Coaching, delegatig and sharing my vision I am able to create environments that promote, sustainable coding practices, better coding standards, opportunities for upskilling and ownership but more importantly greatly improved productivity.

In the end of the day the metric to my successes is in what we deliver. But Its not enough for me to hit a dead line and have our code pushed to production. Its that we where able to do so in a organized, happy manner and ready for the next Sprint.

And I know that as a team lead I could be a valuable asset for Rakuten Kobo


Why do you want to be a team leader.

I want to be a team leader primarily because I enjoy the responsibility. I'm believe my self to be a natural leader with strong soft skills that have proven to be a asset to the projects I have worked on in the past. I'm able to defuse situations, sell visions of goals and motivate people to be the best that they can be. I have grate problem solving skills and thrive on taking responsibility of difficult situations and bringing order to chaos. And this is the same in my private life as I am an avid sailor here in Dublin bay which is about as chaotic as you can imagen. 

So the entire job description of team lead or manager certainly fits my values, strengths and aspirations  


How would you handle a underproforming team mate

Migration team
Hiered by Rim to be the Team leader of an already exist migration inititive, This was the latest rendition of the project where not only would I be bringing in new engineers to the company but also enginers who had been dispersed through out the organization.

I was working with a new teck stack and got to select coding aproches and tool as well as determin our Develmpment and project framework. From testing standards to entity framework I had the opertunity to waighin on and select how the the project was going to move forword. But I also got to decide on how we where going to function as a team, I got to set up ceramonies, organize and manage the backlog and start to devlop a culture that worked for my project. 

The first team I created was the Swift team, named after the agile, migrationary bird and then Galago which is a bushbabby a very agile mammel and then platapuys which is the only creacher in the world that can make custerd. 

The project its self was a migration project and not just a Lift and shift project. Our primary goal was to take a monolithic single tennent .aspx with a very string sql Stordprocedure driven back end, rip out the stored procedures and move everythign into code so that we could actualy test and scale it in a Cloud based, multy tennet microserved based arcetucture. 

But as i said this wasent a simple lift and shift project. Product and design where making improvemnt to the frount end which required us to do deep dives and investagation to insure that the work we where doing was compatable with the original system and database.

And this lead to some serious issues. What followed is what I call
