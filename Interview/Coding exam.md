Coding exams take pace in two arenas.
Online: Though use of a testing portal or tool Normally timed require you to out put a result
In person: White board, require you to openly walk though a problem and its soluting. 

The goal of these exams is to gage your
**Coding ability** 
	Code readability
		Naming
		Style
	Comprehension:
		Understanding what is asked of you
		Technical understanding
		Ambiguity navigation 
	Speed
		Time to understand the topic
		Time to complete a task 
	Algorithms/data structures 
		 Space and time complexity
		 Knowledge of
	Communication
		Did you explain your work well
		Did you ask clarifying questions
		Did you talk to tradeoffs
		Can you explain technical concepts
		Were you closed off or rude 


So there are Three parts to every question
	Part 1: Understanding the prompt
		A: Reading/listening to the problem and understanding it
		B: Identifying Clarifications and questions to get a better understanding of the prompt 
		C: Reiterating the prompt back to the examiner in a friendly way 

	Part 2: First runthough of the solution
		A: Walk though the highest level understanding of the prompt Identifying 
			Identify requirments and Flow
		B: Using clean code and naming get the initial solution down 
			Talk about what you are doing openly, thinking aloude.
			Identify where you can increase effishiency as you go but dont stop
			If you get stuck ask for ferthere clarification if needed. 
			Engage with the examiner if prompted to do so.

	Part 3: Second pass for improving on your solution.
		A: Give Big O values for your initial pass and see where you can make improvments
		B: Make changes to code and call out the Big O improvments

	Part 4: Curve ball
		A: The eximener might give a further requirment at this point
		B: Talk thought the requirment first as you did in Part 1
		C: Get down a initial solution like you did in Part 2
		D: Do a final pass with Big O values as you did in part 4
